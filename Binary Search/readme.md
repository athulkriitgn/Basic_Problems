# Problem Description
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Input 1: 
    nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
# Output 1: 
    4
# Explanation: 
    9 exists in nums and its index is 4

# Input 2: 
    nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
# Output 2: 
    -1
# Explanation: 
    2 does not exist in nums so return -1
