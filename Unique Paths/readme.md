# Problem Description

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
How many possible unique paths are there?

# Input 1:
    m = 3, n = 2
# Output 1:
    3
# Explanation:
    From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
    1. Right -> Down -> Down
    2. Down -> Down -> Right
    3. Down -> Right -> Down

# Input 2: 
    m = 3, n = 7

# Output 2: 
    28

# Input 3:
    m = 7, n = 3
# Output 3:
    28

# Input 4:
    m = 3, n = 3
# Output 4:
    6
